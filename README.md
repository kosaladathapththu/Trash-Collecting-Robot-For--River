## 📝 Abstract

Floating trash such as plastics, polythene, and other debris pollute rivers and canals, creating environmental hazards and health risks. Traditional cleanup methods are costly, time-consuming, and unsafe for human workers. 

This project introduces an **autonomous Trash Collector Robot** that uses DC motors, ultrasonic sensors, servo motors, and a specialized trash-collection mechanism to gather floating waste efficiently. It provides a safe, affordable, and automated solution specifically designed for small-scale water bodies.
